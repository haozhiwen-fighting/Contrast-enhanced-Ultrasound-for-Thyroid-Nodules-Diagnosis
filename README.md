We have proposed a novel method "Do as Sonographers Think: Contrast-enhanced Ultrasound for Thyroid Nodules Diagnosis via Microvascular Infiltrative Awareness".

The thyroid nodule dataset used in this study comprised 282 consecutive patients.
An experienced Sonographer conducted the US examinations
using an iU22 scanner (Philips Healthcare, Bothell, WA) with
a linear transducer L9-3 probe. The US examination involved
the acquisition of both dynamic gray-scale US and CEUS
images simultaneously, using the dual-image display format.
Each frame of the dual-images had a resolution of 600Ã—800
pixels.

Here,we have shown some segmentation result by using different methods. Green and red contours mean the automatically segmented lesion area and ground truth.

Grad-CAM visualization results.Through Grad-CAM visualization results, we can find that our model can accurately focus on the lesion area, instead of only focusing on the noisy, artifactual area of the lesion as in the baseline model.
